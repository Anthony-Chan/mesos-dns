# Contributor Guidelines

## Getting Started

Maybe you already have a bugfix or enhancement in mind.  If not, there may be a
number of relatively approachable issues with the label
["good first bug"](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+bug%22).

## Submitting Changes to Mesos-DNS

- A GitHub pull request is the preferred way of submitting patch sets.

- Any changes in the public API or behavior must be reflected in the project
  documentation.

- Pull requests should include appropriate additions to the unit test suite.

- If the change is a bugfix, then the added tests must fail without the patch
  as a safeguard against future regressions.
